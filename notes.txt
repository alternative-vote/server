Swagger design:
  - one file per field feels weird, but give it a go
  - try to use a single schema definition that works for several routes,
  instead of what you did with message-validator where each message is unique,
  but quickly give up on this and just compose fields into message schemas if that makes more sense.
  You'll get more control over required fields in the body if you go this route, there will just be more schemas.
  Even with more schemas, you can still have a schema that is specific to the object and not just one message to be used in
  responses, which are more consistent.



Super-Swag:
  - change controller to x-super-swag-controller
  - write middleware to set default values.
    - may need to use a custom "relative date" property
